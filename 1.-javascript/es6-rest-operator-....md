# 1.4 Rest Operator - { ... }

* Syntactically, it looks exactly the same as spread operator. But itâ€™s function is the exact opposite of the spread Operator. If Spread operator expands individual items, then rest operator collects a bunch of items and puts them into arrays and objects.
* Example 1: Array rest operator

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [ firstNumber, ...restOfTheNumbers ] = numbers;

console.log(firstNumber, restOfTheNumbers);
// 1 [ 2, 3 ]
```

* Example 2: Object rest operator

```javascript
const details = {
 firstName: 'Stalin',
 lastName: 'Ramesh',
 age: 22
};
const { age, ...other } = details;

console.log(age, other);

// 22 { firstName: 'Stalin', lastName: 'Ramesh' }
```

* Example 3: `...rest` must always be last.

```javascript
const [ firstLetter, ...restOfTheLetters, lastLetter ] = 'Codeburst';
```

* [ ] Give a thought on use cases where we may use this in our codebase.

{% hint style="info" %}
_If we use rest operator to gather function arguments into an array, it is termed as `rest parameter`._
