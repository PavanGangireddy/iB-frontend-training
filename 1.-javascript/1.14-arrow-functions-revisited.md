# 1.14 Arrow Functions Revisited



* Example 1:  Arrow functions do not have `this`

If `this` is accessed, it is taken from the outside.

```javascript
// ES6

let group = {
  title: "Our Group",
  students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],

  showList() {
    this.students.forEach((student) => {
      console.log(this.title + ': ' + student)
    });
  }
};

group.showList();

// Here in forEach, the arrow function is used, 
// so this.title in it is exactly the same as in the outer method showList. 
// That is: group.title.
```

```javascript
// ES5

let group = {
  title: "Our Group",
  students: ["John", "Pete", "Alice"],

  showList() {
    this.students.forEach(function(student) {
      console.log(this.title + ': ' + student)
    });
  }
};

group.showList();

// The error occurs because forEach runs functions with this=undefined 
// by default, so the attempt to access undefined.title is made.

// That doesn’t affect arrow functions, because they just don’t have this.
```

_Arrow functions VS bind_

_There’s a subtle difference between an arrow function `=>` and a regular function called with `.bind(this)`:_

* _`.bind(this)` creates a “bound version” of the function._
* _The arrow `=>` doesn’t create any binding. The function simply doesn’t have `this`. The lookup of `this` is made exactly the same way as a regular variable search: in the outer lexical environment._
